I currently have several openings for ongoing coaching. Spaces are somewhat limited to ensure you can still receive quality coaching. 

Read more about the coaching plans below or contact me (link) with any questions.

Have a burning question or looking for advice on smaller issue? I also offer one-off meetings here (link).

## Basic Plan ($75/month)

* A great option for those looking for some guidance on their training but are comfortable making day-to-day adjustments as needed 
* What's included?
	* Running and optional cross-training
	* Training plan delivered via Google Sheets for simple collaboration
	* Virtual meetings via Zoom every two weeks to refine training
	* Email questions as needed

## The New Runner Plan ($25/month)

* Think of this as a "couch-to-5K" plan but with a more personal touch.
* My goal with the New Runner Plan is to enable you to be confident running on your own. 
	* We'll meet weekly on Zoom to plan out runs that fit your schedule and goals. 
	* In these meetings, I'll explain why I'm recommending the workouts I am, so you can feel confident running on your own.
* This is offered at a significant discount compared to the other plans. 
	* Running has made a huge impact on my life, and this is a way I can make running more accessible to you too!

	* Two months for 20% off
