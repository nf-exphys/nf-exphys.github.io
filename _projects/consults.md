Have questions about a new workout or how to plan a piece of your training but don't want to commit to a long-term training plan? This is for you!

In these consults, I pull from my experiences as a runner, cross country and track coach, and exercise physiology researcher to provide evidence-informed recommendations. 

Examples of previous consults: 
* Creatine supplementation for an obstacle course racer
* Developing a weekly training plan for a working Masters athlete juggling obstacle course and trail races
* Extending a high school track season for to compete in a national age-group race

You can schedule a consult [here] (calendly.com/nick4man). Rates are $40 for half an hour or $70 for an hour. 

If you're a business looking for a consultant, please reach out via [email] (mailto:nforeman22@gwu.edu).
